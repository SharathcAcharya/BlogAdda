# Admin Login Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem

The admin login page was not working correctly due to:

1. Missing admin-specific authentication endpoint
2. Password double-hashing issue in seed script
3. No role validation for admin access

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Admin-Specific Login Endpoint

- Added `/api/auth/admin-login` route in `backend/routes/auth.js`
- Validates admin role before allowing login
- Returns proper error message for non-admin users

### 2. Fixed Password Hashing Issue

- Removed manual password hashing from `backend/seed.js`
- Let User model's pre-save hook handle password hashing
- Prevents double-hashing that made passwords invalid

### 3. Updated Admin API Configuration

- Updated `admin/src/services/authAPI.js` to use correct endpoint
- Maintained proper error handling and token management

## Admin Login Credentials

```
Email: admin@blogadda.com
Password: Admin@123456
```

## Testing Results

✅ Backend endpoint tested successfully via PowerShell
✅ Admin user created with proper role
✅ Password authentication working
✅ Token generation confirmed
✅ Frontend API configuration updated

## Usage

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001
2. Enter admin credentials above
3. Should successfully login to admin dashboard

## Additional Notes

- Backend server running on port 5000
- Admin panel running on port 3001
- All React Router warnings resolved
- Database properly seeded with admin user
